List of problems noticed/suggestion:
=========================
1. Lunch hour time supposed to be always at minimum 24 minutes. ===> webpage is allowing it to change less than 24 minutes. 
2. Inital set period time has to to max for all periods.  ==> issue identifed as, when forst period value is reduced, all non-lunch 9regular periods) values are going more than initially set 42 minutes.    

3. In PeriodThree Function, word Interger used for type cast that is not supported in javaScript. 
4. Add a Print Button to print the modified schedule. ==> need to Modify it to print only the Schedule without buttons and Add the Schedule Date.

5. Lunch Period changing both and down not working. 
	example: increasing time to 35, giving period 5, Period 7 and Period 9 --> negative numbers.
		 decreasing time to 20, giving uneven period 5 number with Period 7and period 9.

6. Between "Lunch Periods & odd periods", there should not be any passing time. but, this version is showing passing time.  but, in the Bell schedule 

7. Each period has to have same time as user selected period time. ==> issue: when we set period 1 as 25 minutes, period 2,3,11 and 12 are staying same 42 minutes. 
   if reduce time for all classes, school may not end by 2:30 pm and it will too early. is this okay? 

Test cases to implement:
=========================
1. School always ends at 2:30PM -  with one or two minutes less is okay. 
2. Period time should never go aobe the intial limit. 



code optimizations/re-orgs:
===========================
1. in TimeFrameCalculation function: move the logic into separate function that has logic of convering the added number to Time format. also, this logic is repeated two times in same function. 

2. Move all static numbers like passingTime=6, DefaultDurations etc into separate file and use those everywhere these are referenced. this will help in preventing missing changes, when we need to modify these numbers. 

3. in HomeRoomEditor function: can we have "abs" function for calculating the difference and convert two if blocks to one block?
